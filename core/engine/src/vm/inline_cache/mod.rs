/// ## Design
///
/// Unlike the named-property PIC, element-access ICs are monomorphic: a
/// site that iterates over one dense array is the overwhelming common case.
/// When a second (different) receiver shape is observed we overwrite the
/// entry with the new shape, betting that the most-recent winner is the
/// future winner too (last-write-wins eviction).
///
/// ## Interior mutability
///
/// The seeded entry is held in a `GcRefCell` so that `seed` can update
/// the IC through a shared `&ElementIC` reference, matching the access
/// pattern used by the named-property `InlineCache::set`. The borrow
/// discipline mirrors the PIC: `matches` holds a short-lived immutable
/// borrow, `seed` holds a brief mutable borrow on the cold (miss) path.
///
/// ## GC soundness
///
/// The same fused address + liveness discipline as [`CacheEntry::matches`]
/// applies here: we store the raw heap address alongside a [`WeakShape`]
/// liveness guard, and the two checks are always performed together in
/// [`ElementIC::matches`]. Splitting them would reintroduce the
/// address-reuse false-positive described in the [`CacheEntry`] docs.
///
/// ## JIT fuel
///
/// [`ElementIC::dense_kind`] exposes the observed storage kind so that JIT
/// Stage 2 can emit a specialised load (e.g. a direct `i32` array read)
/// without re-profiling element accesses from scratch.
